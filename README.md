🚦 Traffic Accident Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to:

Weather conditions

Road conditions

Time of day

Geographic accident hotspots

The goal is to understand contributing factors behind accidents and visualize high-risk areas using data analysis and mapping techniques.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Folium

VS Code

📊 Project Workflow

Data Loading

Data Cleaning (handling missing values)

Feature Engineering (extracting hour from time)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualization of accident patterns

Heatmap generation for accident hotspots

📈 Key Insights

Higher accident frequency observed during evening peak hours.

Rainy and foggy weather conditions increase accident occurrence.

Wet road conditions contribute significantly to accidents.

Heatmap visualization identifies accident-prone areas.

📍 Output
